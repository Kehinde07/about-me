        I am known as Kehinde Olubusayo Olukunle, people call me Kenny most times. I am a yoruba girl from Oyo
        state Ogbomosho, I was born and raised in Kaduna State. I am from a
        family of 6 with my parents inclusive. I have a twin sister, an elder
        sister and a younger brother. I graduated from Babcock University in
        2019 with a degree in Accounting, a course I genuinely can't say I
        enjoyed nor loved.I love hanging out with friends at home or at their
        place. I am extremely introverted so I hardly ever leave my house, or go out to have fun.I am a marvel fan. Some of the movies and series I enjoyed include: Umbrella Academy, Brooklyn99, On my Block, Modern family, Good girls The office, Stranger Things Season 4(it has to be my favorite) I
        enjoy watching movies especially fantasy movies and romance movies(sometimes),
        for horror movies I was tired of screaming and having nightmares, as for
        action movies well I got bored. I love watching YouTube videos and I particularly enjoy Asmr videos, it always makes me fall asleep. 
        I enjoy reading novels and spending time by myself, I hate phone calls it gives me anxiety sometimes when my phone rings so it is mostly on Don't Disturb(DnD).I don't fancy cooking I enjoy baking instead not like I know how to, but I enjoy watching people bake and I decided I would start baking as well. My favorite color has to be beige , I love nude colors. I am also a minimalist and I love things that are aesthetically pleasing. I love food even-though I am extremely skinny. I don't eat junks a lot. I love jumbo braids and wigs, mostly straight and curly. I love outfits that are comfy that don't make me uncomfortable, I don't feel comfortable wearing heels but i wear them sometimes, I love balanced heels but I prefer wearing flats instead. I am not a fan of jewelries either but I like simple and classy ones. I love massages and I watch videos of people getting massages a lot, it always makes me want to sleep. I have a low concentration span to certain things my brain doesn't enjoy. I am not a very social person, I am on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Tik-tok, Whatsapp and LinkedIn but I am only active on; Twitter(I never tweet because I don't want to collect), Snapchat(whenever I wnt to post a picture or take a picture ), Tik-tok(whenever I have enough data to waste and need new songs) Instagram(only whenever I am in the mood or I want to check something) and Whatsapp(I only chat with a few people there) I know should be networking and all, I am aware of that, and I will. I don't like stress but the weird thing is programming is stressful but it is the kind of stress I don't mind. I only get frustrated when the code I am trying to code isn't coding. Yeah!, I forgot to say i finally found the part I want to follow, yeah exactly its programming. I am becoming a Women In Tech!. So I enrolled at Stutern Cohort 1.3. As a software Developer student, it is exciting and I look forward to many more wonderful experiences and sleepless night.
